# Python Starter : Become a multi-language developer

Welcome to your second challenge, we hope that you get to learn something new throughout this challenge and, most importantly, that you have fun !

By working on this challenge, you get to see, in practice, the value of something called **Transfer of Knowledge**.

Basically, Transfer of Knowledge is your ability to apply knwoledge you already have in a new, slightly different context.

The context for this challenge is, you guessed it, **coding** ! So, to solve this challenge you will need to use programming concepts you already learnt in Javascript and apply them in Python.

## Why Python ?
Python, like Javascript, are called [General Purspose Programming Languages](https://g.co/kgs/ni2nRd). And by adding it to the list of your technical skills, you will become more useful in a lot more situations, which increases your market value.

## What needs to be done ?

A. Write a Python script which will find all numbers that are :
1. Between 2000 and 3200 (both included)
2. Divisible by 7 
3. **Not** a multiple of 5
HINT: Consider use range(#begin, #end) method

B. Update this README.md with the insctruction(s) needed to run that script
```shell
<REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_INSTRUCTION>
the number is between 2000 and 3000
first we declare an array 
second we loop through the range between 2000 and 3000 
third we need two condition one the reminder of number%7 must be 0 and the rminder of number%5 must be diffrent than 0
then we append the result to to the array
then we print it 
when in python idle write the arr = [] first, then write the rest of the script

```
