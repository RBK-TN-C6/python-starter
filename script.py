# BEFORE YOU START

# Javascript uses curly brackets {} to delimit code blocks
# Python, however, uses indentation to delimit code blocks

# Let's consider this Javascript code 

# if(hungry) {
# eat();
# } else { dont_eat();
# }


# Notice that the above code does not care about indentation.
# In Python, we NEED to write it this way 

# if(hungry):
#     eat()
# else:
#     dont_eat()

# IMPORTANT : Indentation in a python should have the same size
# Either use 4 spaces or tabs for each indent
# With that information in mind, happy hacking :)

# INSERT YOUR CODE BELOW THIS LINE

def my_function():
 
    arr1 = []
    arr2 = []    
for i in range(3200):
    #print(i, end=', ')
arr1.insert(i)
if i%7 = 0:
    arr2.instert(i)
print(arr2)
